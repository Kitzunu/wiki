# Installation Guide

## Introduction

AzerothCore is a rather complex and demanding software, and as such, it may seem quite daunting to install and maintain. This guide will attempt to describe in detail how to setup your server environment.

Every step of the guide is divided in three tabs (probably more will follow) regarding different operating systems (mainly divided into Linux, macOS and Windows).

The guide has been divided into 7 steps, to make it more readable:

1. [Requirements](requirements.md)

1. [Core Installation](core-installation.md)

1. [Server Setup](server-setup.md)

1. [Database Installation](database-installation.md)

1. [Networking](networking.md)

1. [Final Server Steps](final-server-steps.md)

1. [Client Setup](client-setup.md)

Each step can be read independently or you can read them neatly, to gradually get into it and better understand it all.

*Tip: If this is your first time installing AzerothCore we recommend that you read every step carefully!*
